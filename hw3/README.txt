hw3.py is the python code of my jupyter notebook.
For viewing my code and the results of my findings in #1 and #2 I would 
	recommend using jupyter notebook to view the outputs of my 
	findings.
Running the code through the command prompt will run completely through
	but might take a while.
The hw3answers.pdf is the pdf version of the jupyter notebook and has
	#3 at the end of the pdf (I scanned my handwritten work).
